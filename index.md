# 🧠 Codemikemike Blog – Entry #1

> 🚀 *“Learning in public is the best way to grow fast.”*

Hey hey! 👋 Welcome to the first official post on my GitHub-powered blog.  
This is where I’ll share my **coding journey**, **side projects**, **tech struggles**, and the random breakthroughs that happen somewhere between too much coffee and too little sleep.

---

## 📅 What I'm working on

- Building cool stuff in **C#**
- Playing with **GitHub Actions** and automations
- Setting up this very blog with **Markdown** and **Jekyll**
- Trying to make everything I touch just a little more awesome

---

## 🔧 Current setup

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| VS Code | Writing code and Markdown |
| GitHub Pages | Hosting this blog |
| Markdown | Writing like a boss |
| Git | Keeping track of my chaos |
| C# & .NET | My main stack right now |

## 🧩 What I’ve learned so far

- How to make a GitHub Pages site from scratch  
- How to configure `_config.yml` with a theme and metadata  
- How to write clean, readable Markdown  
- That posting a GIF makes every blog post better 😄

## 🎯 What's next?

- More blog posts (obviously)
- Tutorials and code snippets
- Behind-the-scenes on my projects
- Some design tweaks – maybe dark mode? Maybe neon?
